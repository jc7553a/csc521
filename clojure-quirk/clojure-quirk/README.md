Homework 2

Clojure Interpreter

This assignment was to create a parse tree, and to interpret it through left depth first search algorithm in the programming language
Clojure.

To run a quirk file on the command line simply type in lein run <"YourFile".q 

To output only a parse tree type on command line,   lein run -pt <"Yourfile".q
This command will not output the output of the quirk file only the corresponding parse tree
 
All 5 examples are working, but there are obvious bugs if you go outside the normal examples
Although in Example 5 you may try to return any of the 3 Values that does work.
