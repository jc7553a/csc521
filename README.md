This Assignment was to write a Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter for Quirk Programming Language Developed by Josh Mccoy at AU

To run a quirk file simpley go to you command line and type in the following command

python Lexer.py <"YOURFILE".q | Parser.py | Interpreter.py

The command line will output your output of your quirk program

If you want to just do python Lexer.py <YourFile.q

Look for Comments in the Program in method getDemStringsAndLiterals()
It should be very obvious where it is.

If you want to print out the parse tree in Parser.py by running python Parser.py <YourFile.q
Then again You must Look for printing instructions in main

All these instructions are at the bottom of the Programs and I have made them extremely Clear.
